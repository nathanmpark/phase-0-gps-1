#Jenna Andersen's Git Workflow and Branching Reflection

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	* I'm still working to understand how a team works together using GitHub on the same project
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	* The merge conflict section helped me better understand that teams work together on projects but they will use a standup meeting to divide up their responsibilities so merge conflicts are minimized as much as possible. One person might be assigned to clean up the ReadMe file, another might be adjusting HTML tags on the front page of a website. 
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	* The guide was a great resource when we were going back and forth trying to work out something on our own. And example of this would be when we were trying to work through adding an image to our awesome_page.md and display it inline. The guide clarified that we can push images to GitHub using the terminal, but if we want the image displayed inline in our .md file it needs to be uploaded on the web. On GitHub this is done by creating an issues request. 
	*Our guide also taught us about "git branch -v" which we can use to look at the branches under a given master
4. What still confuses you about git?
	* I'm still muddling through the process of making changes to a project, pushing it to a repository created by someone else, and getting those changes to by synchronized locally for me, remotely for my own repository cloned from someone else, remotely for the repository I cloned from that someone else, owns, and locally for the individual I'm working with.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	* I liked that we were instructed when to switch between driver and navigator. My pair did a great job voicing "I'm going to drive now", which is something I would like to implement as well. It was initially difficult for me to stop driving once I started navigating, but I stopped looking at the instructions and relied on my navigator. I appreciated that my pair was patient with me (I'm currently behind in the coursework) and I learned a lot from watching the navigate via the screenshare.
