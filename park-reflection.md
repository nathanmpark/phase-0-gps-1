# Nathan Park Reflection

>What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with how to utilize the "git commit -v" function, and how to get back from the commit message in sublime.

>What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Clarified what to do in the case of a merge conflict, how to be able to create it, and remedy the situation.

>What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

What origin was - learned that it was simply an alias to your remote.

>What still confuses you about git?

I'm sure there is much to learn, but everything so far has been resolved through futher learning and online research.

>How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It went great, I had an awesome experience working with Jenna and the Guide was great at interjection when needed, but otherwise played a passive role.
